Basic typescript API for the boards app. 

TODO: 
- Maybe add a refresh token to refresh an access token after 24hrs have passed
- cors
- sort validation errors (make cleaner for front end to read)
- validation of incoming requests to check they have the correct fields

Things to remember
- We are using yarn - no npm install - use yarn add instead (-D for dev dependencies)
- When installing any libraries - install the correct types - yarn add -D @types/library
